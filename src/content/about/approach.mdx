title: My <span>approach</span> and <span>mindset</span>
color: green

I'm a strong believer in writing software to <span>solve problems</span>. I therefore try to approach challenges with a <span>product mindset</span>, valuing data and research to inform decisions and direction.

In my work I try to foster a <span>beginner's mindset</span>, a commitment to <span>lifelong learning</span> and an enduring <span>curiosity</span>. I proactively seek out new challenges and opportunities to push myself forwards and ultimately become a <span>better</span> developer.

I care a lot about the <span>impact</span> of my work; I will always try to make decisions that respect the people that use what I build. Therefore, I am very conscious about privacy, analytics and third-party cookies.

When building I value performance, user experience, accessibility, and - perhaps most importantly - <span>positive social impact</span>. In my opinion the people who build software have a <span>responsibility</span> to build responsibly because of the wide-ranging societal impact of technology. I take this responsibility very seriously.
