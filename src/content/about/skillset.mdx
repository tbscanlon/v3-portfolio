- <h3>I'm <span>great</span> at:</h3>
  - <span>HTML, CSS & JS</span>
    - I'm very comfortable writing HTML & CSS, and interacting with browser APIs and the DOM using JavaScript.
  - <span>Front-end frameworks (e.g., React, Angular)</span>
    - I've worked professionally with modern front-end libraries, frameworks and tools since 2017.
  - <span>Design systems</span>
    - In my work I have architected, implemented and contributed to internal design systems. I'm very familar with the benefits and challenges offered by design systems, and what work needs to be done for a sustainable implementation.
  - <span>Test-driven development (TDD)</span>
    - I'm confident in my ability to write clean, testable code and will happily use TDD where appropriate to ensure quality. 
- <h3>I'm <span>good</span> at:</h3>
  - <span>Typescript</span>
    - I've migrated codebases from JS to TS. I'm very comfortable working with types, but would like to dive deeper into the more advanced areas of TS.
  - <span>Software design & architecture</span>
    - I've created and contributed to software architectures for web platforms, with a particular focus in web front-ends. I'd like more exposure to full-stack web architecture in the future.
  - <span>Accessibility</span>
    - At the BBC, I was part of the Accessibility Champion Network. I have a good understanding of web accessibility and know how to test my work to ensure it meets accessibility guidelines and recommendations.
  - <span>Stakeholder communication</span>
    - I'm comfortable communicating with stakeholders, both internal and external. My years working in IT support have given me an ability to explain technical concepts well to non-technical stakeholders.
  - <span>Node.js</span>
    - I can use node.js and its ecosystem, with a preference for using the internal promises-based APIs over the more traditional callback-based ones.
- <h3>I'm <span>familiar</span> with:</h3>
  - <span>Ruby</span>
    - My education in software development was taught with Ruby. I would like to revisist and dive deeper into the language to improve my full-stack development capabilities.
  - <span>Python</span>
    - I'm self-taught in Python, but want to get better because I think scripting and some general-purpose programming tasks would be much easier using Python over JS.
  - <span>Back-end web development</span>
    - I can wire up an API endpoint or put some MVC functionality together if needed, but I have knowledge gaps I want to fill to be more proficient in back-end development.
  - <span>Infrastructure</span>
    - I can find my way around the AWS console, configure nginx and set up docker containers.
  - <span>QA</span>
    - I've worked closely with QA engineers throughout my career. I'm comfortable writing end-to-end tests and identifying areas of software systems that need oversight and coverage by testers.
- <h3>I want to <span>improve</span> in:</h3>
  - <span>Databases</span>
    - I have done some work with relational and non-relational databases, but I want to get better at schema design and normalisation because I feel this is a major blocker stopping me from being a proficient full-stack developer.
  - <span>UI/UX design</span>
    - I appreciate good UI/UX design and work very closely with designers, but I lack the formal training needed to confidently design user interfaces from scratch. I think being able to be cross-functional in my work would make me much more valuable to a team.
  - <span>Mobile app development</span>
    - I have exposure to React Native and some understanding of the challenges within mobile app development, but I would like the opportunity to dive deeper into this.
