I've worked on a wide variety of things over the last few years, from small <span>freelance</span> projects to live products with <span>millions of monthly users</span>.

Alongside my professional work, I also try to dedicate some of my time to <span>volunteer</span> projects. I take great satisfaction in using my skills and knowledge for <span>good causes</span>.

I enjoy working in <span>agile</span> cross-functional teams with fast feedback loops and <span>data-driven</span> decision making.
