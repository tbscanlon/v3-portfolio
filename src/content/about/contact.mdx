import TextContactButton from "@features/chat/components/TextContactButton.astro"

I'm available to work <span>full-time</span> or as a <span>freelancer</span>.

I can work fully <span>remotely</span>, or on a <span>hybrid</span> basis with your team in any major European city.

If you're working on a <span>non-profit</span> or <span>social enterprise</span> venture and you would like some <span>expertise</span> in web or software development, I can assist you on a pro bono basis.
