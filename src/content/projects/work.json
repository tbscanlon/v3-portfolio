      "BBC Sounds is the home for all of the BBC's audio content - music, radio and podcasts. Launched in October 2018, BBC Sounds has since grown to provide live radio and audio-on-demand content to millions of monthly active users.",
      "The BBC Sounds website is a critical part of the platform, as the website can provide instant access to the entire catalogue of audio available on Sounds without any app installation. It's critical that the site is performant, accessible and internationalised to ensure that as many people as possible can access the service.",
      "My work on BBC Sounds has touched the entire stack of the website, from monitoring, to analytics, to API refactors, to accessibility, to testing, to user-facing features and to server performance. Some of my major contributions include the dark theme on the site, auto-localisation logic for regional language visitors and radio stations, schedule pages and web-to-app conversions.",
      "My time working on BBC Sounds has exposed me to the challenges of running a live service at scale, and how feature delivery, architectural concerns, legal regulations, agile process, security and leadership interact with that challenge."
