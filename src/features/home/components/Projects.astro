      <p>
        I've worked on a wide variety of things over the last few years, from
        small <span class="text-green-light">freelance</span> projects to live
        products with <span class="text-green-light"
          >millions of monthly users</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside my professional work, I also try to dedicate some of my time
        to <span class="text-green-light">volunteer</span> projects. I take
        great satisfaction in using my skills and knowledge for <span
          class="text-green-light">good causes</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy working in <span class="text-green-light">agile</span>
         cross-functional teams with fast feedback loops and <span
          class="text-green-light">data-driven</span
        > decision making.
