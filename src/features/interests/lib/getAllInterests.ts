 * - What game I'm playing;
 * - What book I'm reading;
 * - What course I'm studying;
 * - What TV show or film I'm watching;
 *
 * This data is all sourced from publicly available information. Some

 *
 * This code is *only* executed via `npm run get-interests` to generate JSON
 * which is then used as my cached source of truth within `src/features/interests/components/*`.
 * I do this to make sure I don't hit any API limits and to ensure good page load speeds.
