<div class="space-y-4 xl:space-y-8" class:list={className} {...attrs}>
  <p>
    I've worked on a wide variety of things over the last few years, from small <span
      class="text-green-light">freelance</span
    > projects to live products with <span class="text-green-light"
      >millions of monthly users</span
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alongside my professional work, I also try to dedicate some of my time to <span
      class="text-green-light">volunteer</span
    > projects. I take great satisfaction in using my skills and knowledge for <span
      class="text-green-light">good causes</span
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enjoy working in <span class="text-green-light">agile</span>
     cross-functional teams with fast feedback loops and <span
      class="text-green-light">data-driven</span
    > decision making.
  </p>
  <TextLink as="a" href="/portfolio" color="green">
